Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the <a href="https://wheelockpolicycenter.org" target="_blank">Wheelock Educational Policy Center</a> at Boston University. In September 2023, I will join the <a href="https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">School of Education and Social Policy</a> at Northwestern University as a Lead Economist.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the  <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a> in 2021. 

My research interests are labor economics and the economics of education.
