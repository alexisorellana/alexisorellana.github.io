Welcome! I am a Lead Economist at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the Wheelock Policy Educational Center at Boston University.

My research interests are labor economics and the economics of education.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the  <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/" target="_blank">University of Rochester</a> in 2021. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist at the Chilean Antitrust Agency and as a Lecturer at the University of Chile.
