I am a Lead Economist at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. Prior to this role, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the Wheelock Policy Educational Center at Boston University.

My research interests are labor economics and the economics of education.

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Rochester. Before starting doctoral studies, I worked as an economist at the Chilean Antitrust Agency and as a lecturer at the University of Chile.
