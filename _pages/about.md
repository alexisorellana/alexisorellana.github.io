I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Institute for Economic Policies at Universidad Andrés Bello in Santiago, Chile. Prior to this position, I was a Lead Economist at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University and a Postdoctoral Associate at the Wheelock Educational Policy Center at Boston University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of labor economics and the economics of education.

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Rochester. I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and a M.Sc. in Applied Economics from the University of Chile. Before starting doctoral studies, I worked as an economist at the Chilean Antitrust Agency.
