<li> Neighbors' Spillovers on High School Choice (with <a href="https://jjmatta.notion.site" target="_blank">Juan Matta</a>) - <em> Job Market Paper </em> </li>
<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Do neighbors affect each others’ schooling choices? We exploit oversubscription lotteries in Chile’s centralized school admission system to identify the effect of close neighbors on application and enrollment decisions. A student is 7-10% more likely to rank a high school as their first preference and to attend that school if their closest neighbor attended it the prior year. These effects are stronger among applicant-neighbor pairs with lower education, college expectations, and prior academic achievement, measured by previous scores in national standardized tests. Lower-achieving applicants are more likely to follow neighbors to schools with better attributes when their closest neighbor’s test scores are higher. Our findings suggest the existence of frictions that prevent some families from learning about all available schools. Targeted policies aimed at increasing information to disadvantaged families have the potential to alleviate these frictions and generate significant multiplier effects.

<li> Teacher Mis-assessments and High School Outcomes - <em> Under Review </em> </li> 
<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Does mis-assessment by teachers on subjective evaluations matter for students’ educational outcomes? I employ administrative data from North Carolina that contain standardized test scores and teacher assessments for each ninth-grade student to examine whether exposure to a teacher whose judgments differ systematically from students’ achievement levels impacts student outcomes. Exposure to teachers who are more likely to overassess students, relative to what test scores signal, increases GPA and college expectations for girls and non-white students. In terms of SAT scores, I find increases for blacks and Hispanics but decreases for Asian students.

<li> COVID-19 and the Composition of the Massachusetts Teacher Workforce (with <a href="https://www.andrewbacherhicks.com/home" target="_blank">Andrew Bacher-Hicks</a> and <a href="https://www.oliviachi.com" target="_blank">Olivia Chi</a>) - <em> Conditionally accepted at Educational Researcher </em> </li>

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

The unprecedented challenges of teaching during COVID-19 prompted fears of a mass exodus from the profession. We examine the extent to which these fears were realized using administrative records of Massachusetts teachers between 2015-16 and 2021-22. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, average turnover rates were similar going into the fall of 2020 but increased by 17 percent (from 15.0 to 17.5) going into the fall of 2021. The fall 2021 increases were particularly high among newly hired teachers (31 percent increase), but were lower among Black and Hispanic/Latinx teachers (5 percent increases among both groups). Gaps in turnover rates between schools serving higher and lower concentrations of economically disadvantaged students narrowed during the first 18 months of the pandemic. The same holds true for gaps in turnover between schools serving higher and lower shares of Black and Hispanic/Latinx students. Together, these findings highlight important differences in teachers’ responses to the pandemic across subgroups, as well as the need to improve early-career retention to ensure long-term stability within the teacher workforce.

<li> Aspirations, Education, and Occupations (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kegontantk/" target="_blank">Kegon Tan</a>) </li> 

<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

It is well documented that children often “inherit” their parents’ occupations. This paper studies the role of early occupational aspirations in determining later life outcomes, a potentially important channel for intergenerational correlations in occupations. Using the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we estimate a lifecycle model of college choice and occupation choice to quantify the effect of aspirations on education and wages. We find that aspirations have a sizeable impact on educational attainment and wages, even conditional on latent skills that we recover from the choice model. We also simulate the importance of family background conditional on skills through the strong correlation between family background and aspirations. Our findings suggest that aspirations may be valuable for reducing intergenerational inequality.

<li> Coworker Networks, Residential Neighbors, and Earnings Growth - <em> W.E. Upjohn Institute Early Career Research Award </em> </li> 

<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

I study the relevance of former coworkers and neighbors to explain job mobility and earnings growth patterns for workers in the United States. Using matched employer-employee data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics I construct individual-level proxies of new job opportunities available to workers using the number of new hires in firms where previous coworkers and close neighbors work. I extend the empirical framework of Caldwell and Harmon (2019) to isolate the effect of individual-level networks from other determinants of job mobility. I merge these records to multiple rounds of the American Community Survey to investigate heterogeneity across occupations and college majors.

<li> Licensure Tests and Teacher Supply (with <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/marcuswinters/" target="_blank">Marcus Winters</a>) </li> 

<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Public school administrators struggle to staff classrooms with qualified teachers, especially within shortage areas such as STEM. Applying a regression discontinuity design to administrative data from Connecticut, we provide causal evidence that licensure test requirements reduce the supply of eligible teachers by deterring candidates who fail their first attempt. The effect is especially large for those seeking an endorsement to teach STEM subjects. The deterrent effect grows substantially larger for scores further away from the passing threshold. Consistent with findings from other states, licensure test scores are only modestly correlated with a teacher’s later value-added contribution to student test scores.
