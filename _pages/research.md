<li> Teacher Mis-assessments and High School Outcomes <em> (Submitted) </em> </li> 
<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Does mis-assessment by teachers on subjective evaluations matter for students’ educational outcomes? I employ administrative data from North Carolina that contain standardized test scores and teacher assessments for each ninth-grade student to examine whether exposure to a teacher whose judgments differ systematically from students’ achievement levels impacts student outcomes. Exposure to teachers who are more likely to overassess students, relative to what test scores signal, increases GPA and college expectations for girls and non-white students. In terms of SAT scores, I find increases for blacks and Hispanics but decreases for Asian students.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

The unprecedented challenges of teaching during COVID-19 prompted fears of a mass exodus from the profession. We examine the extent to which these fears were realized using administrative records of Massachusetts teachers between 2015-16 and 2021-22. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, average turnover rates were similar going into the fall of 2020 but increased by 17 percent (from 15.0 to 17.5) going into the fall of 2021. The fall 2021 increases were particularly high among newly hired teachers (31 percent increase), but were lower among Black and Hispanic/Latinx teachers (5 percent increases among both groups). Gaps in turnover rates between schools serving higher and lower concentrations of economically disadvantaged students narrowed during the first 18 months of the pandemic. The same holds true for gaps in turnover between schools serving higher and lower shares of Black and Hispanic/Latinx students. Together, these findings highlight important differences in teachers’ responses to the pandemic across subgroups, as well as the need to improve early-career retention to ensure long-term stability within the teacher workforce.

<li> Neighbor Spillovers in High School Choice (with <a href="https://jjmatta.github.io" target="_blank">Juan Matta</a>)</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

This paper studies neighbor spillovers in high school choices. We exploit the implementation of a centralized school admission system in Chile to identify the effect of close neighbors on application and enrollment decisions. We find that, on average, a close neighbor attending a school increases by around one percentage point the probability of ranking this school in the first preference in the next admission process and the probability of attending this school in 9th grade. These estimates represent an increase of 6% and 8% relative to the baseline levels. These effects concentrate on families with lower education, college expectations, and academic achievement, measured by previous scores in national standardized tests. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at increasing information to parents could produce significant spillover effects.
