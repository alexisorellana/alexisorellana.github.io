<li> Teacher Mis-assessments and High School Outcomes <em> (Submitted) </em> </li>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper studies neighbor spillovers in high school choices. We exploit the implementation of a centralized school admission system in Chile to identify the effect of close neighbors on application and enrollment decisions. We find that, on average, a close neighbor attending a school increases by around one percentage point the probability of ranking this school in the first preference in the next admission process and the probability of attending this school in 9th grade. These estimates represent an increase of 6\% and 8\% relative to the baseline levels. These effects concentrate on families with lower education, college expectations, and academic achievement, measured by previous scores in national standardized tests. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at increasing information to parents could produce significant spillover effects.
